# The-Cold-Above
What does space + ice make? The Cold Above, a mod that is both frosty and cosmic. This mod also brings back the penguin from the 2023 mob vote and the iceologer from the 2020 mob vote. One more thing, some cosmic dimensions can lead you to places you might recognize.

Features:
- Asteroid and comets will occasionally fall in the overworld. Asteroids will give players asteroid stone and a group of 2-4 gloops, tangleds, flatworms (cosmic), peacock spiders, capricorns, slithering cats, manta rays (cosmic), somniworms, blobs, carcyns, murrixes, hippies, stone chickens, fuzzy worms, cortexes, bookworms, déjà-vus, crowneds, orbels, crystal foxes, starballoons, cosmollusks, tentrixes, or space whales can spawn near the crash site. Comets, however, give the player ice blocks and loot that include rubies, stardusts, diamonds, lapis, emeralds, opals, zircons, amethyst shards, quartz, moon stone, mars stone, gemina stone, droopy dragon eggs, or in rare cases, netherite and armor trims, might come with two new armor trims.
- Aurorae will appear in any cold biome or in any taiga or mountain variants.
- Rubies, sapphires, opals, zircons, emeralds, amethyst shards, and quartz can be used as currency with aliens like gloops, slithering cats, somniworms, blobs, carcyns, murrixes, hexacrons, hippies, cortexes, déjà-vus, bookworms, orbels, crowneds, cosmollusks, tentrixes, and tangleds. Aliens can barter rubies, sapphires, zircons, opals, emeralds, amethyst shards, or quartz for special loot. The loot might vary according to what was given to an alien. Rubies, sapphires, opals, and zircons will give better loot than emeralds, amethyst shards, or quartz.
- Ice portals are now possible and each portal have the possibility to send you to a random cosmic dimension. Throwing a crocus in the ice portal will lead you to the crocus dimension. Throwing a phlox will lead you to the phlox dimension. Throwing a book will lead you to the storybook dimension. If none of the mentioned items are thrown, the cosmic dimensions will be random.
- A zombie or a drowned in powdered snow will transform into a frostbitten. Husks will transform into normal zombies before transforming into frostbittens. Frostbittens can turn into drowneds if they're submerged for too long.
- Placing a ring of blue ice by 4x4 and placing stardust clumps on each block of blue ice will generate an ice portal, what allows the player to travel in space.
- Placing maple syrup and a stick on a snow block will turn the syrup and the stick into maple taffy. The snow block will take 15 seconds to turn the maple syrup and the stick into maple taffy. Eating the maple taffy will turn it back into a stick.
- Yetis are attracted to mints. It's also with mints that you breed yetis. Shearing yetis will give the player yeti fur, material that can be added into any armor (including horse, nautilus, or wolf armor) for insulation without sacrificing durability with leather. Insulated boots of any tiers allow player to walk on powdered snow, making leather boots in mid to late game less of a burden.
- Renaming a smilodon "Diego" will change its model to the famous character from Ice Age.
- Wooden shacks can often have smilodon husks and woolly rhinoceros husks as loot.
- Penguins will make boats faster.
- Icelogers will appear in raids.
- Stardust and rubies, sapphires, opals, zircons, emeralds, amethyst shards, or quartz can also be used to craft cat armor, that will protect cats, give better gifts, and repels creepers and phantoms from further away.
- In the storybook dimension, special blocks compose this dimension. None of the blocks that naturally generate in this dimension can be broken.
- At the (0,0) coordinates of the Phlox and Crocus dimension awaits the Phlox Titan and the Crocus Titan respectively, both are invulnerable.
- Manta rays spawned in space or the end become cosmic rays. Manta rays spawned in the nether become fire rays. Manta rays spawned in the overworld will just be normal manta rays. Normal manta rays can suffocate if out of the water for too long, except if they're in the nether, in that case, they turn into fire rays.
- Narwhals, belugas, and orcas can die if beached for too long (not because of suffocation).
- Fire rays can be a great transportation method in the nether, but risky in the overworld because rain hurts fire rays. Cosmic rays are more appropriate for traveling in the overworld, although not immune to fire unlike fire rays.
- Goo can be dropped from gloops and tangleds and can be smelted into slimeballs.
- Armadillos run from peacock spiders.
- Peacock spiders attack spiders and cave spiders.
- Comets and asteroids are more likely during an aurora.
- Frostbittens cause freezing damage for 5 seconds when they attack.
- Droopy dragons can spawn on some cosmic dimensions or its egg can either be obtained from comets or bartered by aliens. Right clicking on a droopy dragon will give the player the unused Droopy Likes Your Face music disc.
- Snow golems can now have different faces and can even be equipped with carrots or golden carrots.
- Woolly rhinoceroses can be dyed in any color, they also yield more wool than sheep, but they're neutral mobs.
- The Moon regenerates every time the player exits the Moon dimension.
- Goo blocks and gooey pistons can move every block except command blocks, bedrock, end portal frames, barrier blocks, and reinforced deepslate.
- Yetis can also spawn in the Mars dimension.
- Stone chickens will drop Mars stone every 5-10 seconds.
- Fuzzy worms love to hang out in stellarwood and xenoowood trees.
- Snow golems can be created with carved melons, granting you the melon snow golem, just a visual variant of the existing snow golem.
- Bone mealing a phlox or a crocus will turn it into the huge variant of the flower.
- To venture the abyss, lights that can be place underwater would be required as the abyss are 100% pitch black with a few glowing mobs. The pressure is also a thing to take into consideration. Enchanting your armor with pressure standing will make it easier for you to stand the pressure. Having one piece of armor enchanted with pressure standing will only reduce pressure damage of 25%, two for 50%, three for 75%, and all for immunity to pressure damage.
- Pressure standing is also great for dimensions with different pressure levels to the surface.
