Features:
- Asteroid and comets will occasionally fall in the overworld. Asteroids will give players asteroid stone and a group of 2-4 gloops, tangleds, flatworms (cosmic), peacock spiders, capricorns, slithering cats, manta rays (cosmic), somniworms, or space whales can spawn near the crash site. Comets, however, give the player ice blocks and loot that include rubies, stardusts, diamonds, lapis, emeralds, moon stone, droopy dragon eggs, or in rare cases, netherite and armor trims, might come with two new armor trims.
- Aurorae will appear in any cold biome or in any taiga or mountain variants.
- Rubies are used as currency with aliens like gloops, slithering cats, somniworms, and tangleds. Aliens can barter rubies for special loot.
- Ice portals are now possible and each portal have the possibility to send you to a random cosmic dimension. Throwing a crocus in the ice portal will lead you to the crocus dimension. Throwing a phlox will lead you to the phlox dimension. Throwing a book will lead you to the storybook dimension. If none of the mentioned items are thrown, the cosmic dimensions will be random.
- A zombie or a drowned in powdered snow will transform into a frostbitten. Husks will transform into normal zombies before transforming into frostbittens. Frostbittens can turn into drowneds if they're submerged for too long.
- Placing a ring of blue ice by 4x4 and placing stardust clumps on each block of blue ice will generate an ice portal, what allows the player to travel in space.
- Placing maple syrup and a stick on a snow block will turn the syrup and the stick into maple taffy. The snow block will take 15 seconds to turn the maple syrup and the stick into maple taffy. Eating the maple taffy will turn it back into a stick.
- Yetis are attracted to mints. It's also with mints that you breed yetis. Shearing yetis will give the player yeti fur, material that can be added into any armor (including horse, nautilus, or wolf armor) for insulation without sacrificing durability with leather. Insulated boots of any tiers allow player to walk on powdered snow, making leather boots in mid to late game less of a burden.
- Renaming a smilodon "Diego" will change its model to the famous character from Ice Age.
- Wooden shacks can often have smilodon husks and wooly rhinoceros husks as loot.
- Penguins will make boats faster.
- Icelogers will appear in raids.
- Stardust and rubies can also be used to craft cat armor, that will protect cats, give better gifts, and repels creepers and phantoms from further away.
- In the storybook dimension, special blocks composed this dimension. None of the blocks that naturally generate in this dimension can be broken.
- At the (0,0) coordinates of the Phlox and Crocus dimension awaits the Phlox Titan and the Crocus Titan respectively, both are invulnerable.
- Manta rays spawned in space or the end become cosmic rays. Manta rays spawned in the nether become fire rays. Manta rays spawned in the overworld will just be normal manta rays. Normal manta rays can suffocate if out of the water for too long, except if they're in the nether, in that case, they turn into fire rays.
- Narwhals, belugas, and orcas can die if beached for too long (not because of suffocation).
- Fire rays can be a great transportation method in the nether, but risky in the overworld because rain hurts fire rays. Cosmic rays are more appropriate for traveling in the overworld, although not immune to fire unlike fire rays.
- Goo can be dropped from gloops and tangleds and can be smelted into slimeballs.
- Armadillos run from peacock spiders.
- Peacock spiders attack spiders and cave spiders.
- Comets and asteroids are more likely during an aurora.
- Frostbittens cause freezing damage for 5 seconds when they attack.
- Droopy dragons can spawn on some cosmic dimensions or its egg can either be obtained from comets or bartered by aliens. Right clicking on a droopy dragon will give the player the unused Droopy Likes Your Face music disc.
- Snow golems can now have different faces and can even be equipped with carrots or golden carrots.
- Woolly rhinoceroses can be dyed in any color, they also yield more wool than sheep, but they're neutral mobs.
